# python-Turtle-Race
The Turtle Race project is an interactive simulation using Python's turtle graphics. Users can choose between 2 and 10 turtles to race, with each moving forward at random speeds. The program visually displays the race and announces the winner when a turtle crosses the finish line, providing an engaging experience.
